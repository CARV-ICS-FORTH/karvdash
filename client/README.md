# Karvdash API client

Karvdash (Kubernetes CARV dashboard) is a dashboard service for Kubernetes. It supplies the landing page for working on a Kubernetes cluster, manages users, launches notebooks, and wires up relevant storage to the appropriate paths inside running containers.

The API client library provides a class to interact with a Karvdash installation using function calls. It also includes a command line tool, `karvdash-client`, to run respective API commands from the CLI.
